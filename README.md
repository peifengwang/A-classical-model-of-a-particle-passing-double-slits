A classical model is presented that, due to electric field, when a particle is passing double slits, a self induced force can arise so that the particle is impacted by both slits simultaneously to form concentration varying patterns. While this model may not precisely account for the interference fringes, it raises a question on the origin of the diffraction patterns and imposes restrictions on wave-particle duality.
